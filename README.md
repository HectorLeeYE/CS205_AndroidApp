### SMUBird! is a CS205 project for the Module CS205 Operating System Concepts With Android
**The task was to create an Android app with either Java or Kotlin, using Android Studio Code, and to implement some form of concurrency, along with a few other additional features.**

The 5 **compulsory** features to implement include:
1) Application contains



Uses Mutex and Multithreading, got an A+. To all SMU students who are trying to Google for a game, I don't mind if you use mine, but at the very least just ask me for permission or credit me, yeah?  
All the code is in Branch V0.1  


ChangeLog At A Glance  
Current Most Updated Branch: V0.1  

Master: First Push -> Contains entire app with sounds, and some basic threading. Kanban created  

V0.1: Second Push, new Branch V0.1 -> Implementation of Google Ads (Its an acceptable "advanced_feature")   

HEAD  
V0.1: Third Push -> Implementation of MultiThreading to play BGM Audio within MainActivity.java  
V0.1: 4th Push -> Implemented code to vibrate everytime onTouch (Doesnt work on mine idk why)
V0.1: 5th Push -> Fixed Vibration Bug (Still doesnt vibrate on mine), Brought version forward inline with project requirements  
V0.1: 6th Push -> Fixed Vibe Bug AGAIN, Added Options page with back to game button & mute music button, except mute music isnt working  
V0.1: 7th Push -> ADDED BOMB IMPLEMENTATION + Mute music not working + Vibration compiles but doesnt vibrate on mine 
(Currently the Bombs fly across the top and bottom of the screen at high speed -> need to edit the code params such that they appear as static objects  
at random positions on the screen as the game progresses + handle collision event on them)
